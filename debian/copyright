     Unix configure
     Installation instructions
     Test programs
     PerlMagick test scripts
     JP2 image coder
     Windows configure scripts
     Some web page improvements

ImageMagick makes use of third-party "delegate" libraries to support certain optional features. These libraries bear their own copyrights and licenses, which may be more or less restrictive than the ImageMagick license. For convenience, when ImageMagick is bundled with (or compiled with) "delegate" libraries, a copy of the licenses for these libraries is provided in a "licenses" directory.
